# Supabase Clone in Go - Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to create a Supabase-like backend service written in Go, designed to be highly performant and deployable on serverless platforms like Vercel and Netlify. The system will integrate with Clerk for authentication and provide similar functionality to Supabase, including database operations, row-level security (RLS), and a RESTful API.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **API Layer** - RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints built with Go
2. **Authentication** - Clerk integration with JWT verification
3. **Database Layer** - PostgreSQL with RLS policies
4. **Middleware** - Request processing, validation, and error handling
5. **Serverless Handlers** - Compatible with Vercel/Netlify serverless functions

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (with Fiber or Chi framework for routing)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Clerk with JWT verification
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify compatible Go functions
- **Frontend**: Next.js (existing)

## Key Features
1. **Database Operations**
   - CRUD operations via RESTful API
   - Auto-generated REST API endpoints based on database schema
   - Query filtering and pagination

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Clerk integration
   - JWT verification
   - Role-based access control

3. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Dynamic policy enforcement
   - User-based data access restrictions
   - Declarative security rules

4. **Real-time Subscriptions** (future enhancement)
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Change data capture for database events

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Connection pooling
   - Query caching
   - Efficient JSON serialization

## Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Implement basic Go API server
   - Create database connection and models
   - Integrate Clerk authentication

2. **Phase 2: API Development**
   - Implement RESTful endpoints
   - Add query capabilities (filtering, sorting, pagination)
   - Create database schema management

3. **Phase 3: Security & RLS**
   - Implement row-level security policies
   - Add JWT verification middleware
   - Create security policy management

4. **Phase 4: Serverless Deployment**
   - Optimize for serverless environments
   - Create deployment configurations for Vercel/Netlify
   - Implement connection management strategies

5. **Phase 5: Testing & Optimization**
   - Performance testing
   - Security auditing
   - API documentation

## Design Principles
1. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
2. **Developer Experience**: Create a familiar API similar to Supabase
3. **Security by Default**: Implement secure practices throughout
4. **Scalability**: Design for growth and high load
5. **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and comprehensive documentation
